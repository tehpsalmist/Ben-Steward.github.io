As I was working on putting the conference together, it seemed right to me that we should have a landing page to direct our potential guests. I decided to give my newly acquired skills some practice and built this site from scratch and hosted it on GitHub pages.",

Other than documenting some of our favorite skate spots, my primary goal in this project was to achieve the desired functionality while honoring separation of concerns as carefully as possible. The Google Maps API made this a challenging task, but KnockoutJS simplifies the MVVM concept to a very manageable system. In the future, I would like to try my hand at writing my own 2-way data binding framework. Also, skateboarding. More of that, too...",

Whether or not you agree with that premise, Jasmine's declarative syntax certainly comes close to pulling it off.

However, once that test is written, the code flows forth rather effortlessly, as the programmer has familiarized himself with all angles of the problem before even beginning to write.",

I had just ported the entire FCA Student Information System over to a new software platform, and I was excited to dig into the new functionality available. When I stumbled on the customization Kit, I was immediately inspired by the possibilities for our brand. I spent the next month meticulously combing through the API documentation and learning about radical concepts like loops and variables. The document itself was built using Microsoft Excel to establish the grid layout, which was then saved as HTML. I was fascinated by the whole process, but didn't realize the impact these small discoveries would have 3 years later.",
